# Predicting-The-Age-of-a-Person-from-a-Photo

A supermarket chain called Good Seed wanted to see if Data Science could help them comply with the law by making sure they weren't selling age-restricted products to underage customers. You are also asked to carry out an evaluation. Therefore, when you start work, remember the following:

- Stores from this franchise are equipped with a camera in the cashier area that will display a signal when someone buys a product with an age limit
- Computer vision methods can be used to determine a person's age from a photograph
- Your task is to build and evaluate a model to verify a person's age
To start doing this task, you will get a set of photos of people with their ages.
